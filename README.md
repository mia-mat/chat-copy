A 1.8.9 Forge QOL Mod, 
and a personal experience in learning mixins.  

**Allows for copying of any chat message through pressing ctrl and left-clicking.**  

I got annoyed with all the other mods with a chat copy having 2 billion other un-needed features so made this.

## Dev Environment
Forge 1.8.9 seems to dislike any version of IntelliJ above 2021.3, downgrading is recommended.
